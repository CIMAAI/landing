              California FHA Loans are one of the easiest mortgage loans to qualify for. 
              The FHA program now allows credit scores at 580 and below. FHA requires a
              low down payment at 3.5% down. If you're in the market for a home, you owe
              it to yourself to research California FHA loan options!

                    That is ok! Many times the sellers can pay all of your closing costs. This way you will only be
                    responsible for the 3.5% down payment.
