      - question: What is a jumbo mortgage?
        answer: >
          A jumbo mortgage is a home loan for an amount that exceeds conforming
          loan limits established by the federal housing finance agency. The
          conventional loan limit is $726,200 in Texas.
      - question: Are jumbo cash out refinances available?
        answer: >
          Yes! We also have no documentation investment jumbo cash out options
          up 75% LTV. This means the underwriting approval is based on the
          property and not your income. No tax returns are needed.
      - question: What credit score is required?
        answer: >
          We now have jumbo mortgage options for buyers with credit scores down
          to 620! The lower your credit score the more you will need to put
          down. Purchase, refinance and cash out options are also available for
          scores down to 620.
      - question: Can you get a jumbo mortgage with no tax returns?
        answer: >
          Yes! We do have programs that don't require any tax returns.  If you
          take the max write offs we have a solution for you.  If you have not
          filed in a year or two, we also have options for you.
      - question: Where are these programs available?
        answer: |
          These programs are available in all of Texas.
      - question: Why use our services?
        answer: >
          We specialize in jumbo mortgages in Texas (meaning loan amounts over
          $726,200). Most conventional lenders require a 20% – 25% down payment
          on these loans. We will work with your situation so you can keep more
          money in your pocket (for example, with smaller down payments as low
          as 5%).

      - question: What are the monthly payments for grants?
        answer: "* The monthly payment will depend on whether it is a repayable or forgivable grant.\_\n* Repayable DPA grant has a 10-year term with an interest rate of 2% higher than the interest rate on the FHA first mortgage.\_\n* For example, if the FHA first lien is 7.75%, then the grant rate is 9.75%. On a 350,000-purchase price, the down payment grant of 3.5% would be $12,250. On a 10-year term, the monthly payment for the $12,250 grant would be $160 a month for 10 years.\_\n* Forgivable DPA grant does not have a monthly payment.\n"
      - question: 'What if I have poor credit? '
        answer: >
          You may be eligible with credit scores down to 600! Don’t worry if you
          are below that number. Our licensed loan officers can work with you to
          understand your score. Our loan officers are well versed in working
          with many homeowners regarding their credit scores.
      - question: 'Do I have to be a first time home buyer? '
        answer: >
          You do NOT have to be a first-time homebuyer to be approved for down
          payment assistance. It is only required that the home you are
          purchasing will be your primary residence.
      - question: 'How do I know if I make too much? '
        answer: "We have programs with no income limits! Your income impacts the rate.\_\n\nWe also have programs where your income must be less than 135% of your area median income. Our licensed loan officers can check the limits for your area extremely fast.\_\n"
      - question: What property types can I buy with DPA grant programs?
        answer: >
          You can buy single family homes, condos, modular/manufactured homes,
          and even properties with up to 2 units (such as a duplex).
      - question: Can I have a non-occupant co-borrower?
        answer: >
          Yes, absolutely. We have programs that allow for a non-occupant
          co-borrower.
