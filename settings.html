      - question: "I can come up with the 3.5% down payment but I don't have the funds for the closing cost?"
        answer: >
          <p>
            That is ok! Many times the sellers can pay all of your closing costs. This way you will only be
            responsible for the 3.5% down payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't forget you can receive the 3.5% as a gift from a family member or you can receive the 3.5%
            down payment from your 401k.
          </p>
      - question: "I know I have a 620 FICO and I feel discouraged. What do I do?"
        answer: >
          <p>
            Please move forward with the application and let our team give you guidance on what needs to be
            done to improve your scores. In some cases you could possibly be pre-qualified with scores below
            580 if you put more than 3.5% down. Our team will take the time with every single applicant to
            make sure a long term plan is put in place so you can own a home.
          </p>
      - question: "I filed for bankruptcy 2 years ago so I probably can't get pre approved?"
        answer: >
          <p>
            That isn't true. You may be approved 2 years after the discharge date of a Chapter 7 or Chapter 11
            bankruptcy. For a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may still be approved while you are in repayment.
          </p>
      - question: "I had a foreclosure 2 years ago as well?"
        answer: >
          <p>
            You will need to wait 3 years from the foreclosure date before you can qualify for a FHA mortgage.
          </p>
      - question: "Where is this program available?"
        answer: >
          <p>
            This program is available in Texas, California, Florida, Colorado and most other states! And the good news is we have a team of people available to help in most states!
