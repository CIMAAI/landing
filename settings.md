      We're here to answer all of your questions about FHA loans!
    faqs:
      - question: >-
          I can come up with the 3.5% down payment but I don't have the funds
          for the closing cost?
        answer: >
          That is ok! Many times the sellers can pay all of your closing costs.
          This way you will only be responsible for the 3.5% down payment.


          Don't forget you can receive the 3.5% as a gift from a family member
          or you can receive the 3.5% down payment from your 401k.
      - question: I know I have a 620 FICO and I feel discouraged. What do I do?
        answer: >
          Please move forward with the application and let our team give you
          guidance on what needs to be

          done to improve your scores. In some cases you could possibly be
          pre-qualified with scores below

          580 if you put more than 3.5% down. Our team will take the time with
          every single applicant to

          make sure a long term plan is put in place so you can own a home.
      - question: >-
          I filed for bankruptcy 2 years ago so I probably can't get pre
          approved?
        answer: >
          That isn't true. You may be approved 2 years after the discharge date
          of a Chapter 7 or Chapter 11

          bankruptcy. For a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may still be approved
          while you are in repayment.
      - question: I had a foreclosure 2 years ago as well?
        answer: >
          You will need to wait 3 years from the foreclosure date before you can
          qualify for a FHA mortgage.
      - question: Where is this program available?
        answer: >
